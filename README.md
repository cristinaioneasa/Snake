# Snake
### About
I attempted to recreate the Snake game using assembly language in this program. I utilized the canvas framework for drawing the objects

### Controls
To control the movement of the snake we use the keys A, D, W, S.

A -> left

D -> right

W -> up

S -> down

### Score
When the snake eats an apple it gets 100 points and it wins when it collects 600 points, but if it hits a wall it loses.
